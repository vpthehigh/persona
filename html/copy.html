wants to invest $1 million in your idea, then teach you how to really sell it"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The investment firm Sequoia Capital has no shortage of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/sequoia-capital-has-internal-crash-courses-for-its-founders-heres-how-they-work\/\">internal programs<\/a> for the founders it backs. The idea is to help its startups not merely by sheer dint of their affiliation with Sequoia but by helping them at the outset with everything from storytelling to recruiting strategies in order to give them an edge over rivals.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sequoia is using some of that know-how for a longer, seven-week-long program called Arc that it&#8217;s using to bring even more promising founders into the fold. The idea, broadly speaking, is to invest $1 million in each company that fits the firm&#8217;s criteria, after which Sequoia brings the startups together both in person and virtually before gathering them together again to present what they&#8217;ve learned to the partnership &#8212; along with potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, 17 startups are finishing the program in Europe and roughly the same number will be welcome into a U.S. and Latin America program this September. (Startups can apply <a href=\"https:\/\/arc.sequoiacap.com\/\">here <\/a>through July 22.) To learn more, we talked today with Sequoia partner Jess Lee, who is leading the initiative this fall. We also talked with Lee about whether Y Combinator might see Arc as a competitor, the deal terms that startups should never accept, and more. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Arc is an outgrowth of Sequoia&#8217;s internal programs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>JL: That&#8217;s right. There&#8217;s so much that goes into building an amazing company, and what we&#8217;ve tried to do over the course of many years, across multiple programs, is boil all of that down into foundational company building concepts on topics like culture, hiring, product, customer obsession, and business model, and [we&#8217;re] packing that into Arc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You received thousands of applications for the Europe program. Who reads all those applications?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All the investors at Sequoia on the early team are reading them. We talked with many, many founders who applied and ultimately ended up with this wonderful class.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Each of these teams receives $1 million dollars. What size stake does Sequoia receive in exchange for its capital? Is it 10%? More?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have flexibility around the terms. What you said would be pretty typical for some folks for whom this is the first check. Then there are some folks who were already in the process of raising their seed round, and so we put $1 million into that round; [others] even opened up their last round to join the program. So there&#8217;s definitely a little bit of a range. Most of the companies are pre-seed or seed, though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The program uses the word &#8220;outlier&#8221; to describe what it&#8217;s looking to fund, but it sounds like Sequoia doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;outlier&#8221; to mean that it is seeking out founders from non-traditional backgrounds.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really looking for founders who want to build long-term, transformational, category-defining companies . . . that carve out a new market. There is no one we&#8217;d rule out, but it&#8217;s more about the scale of ambition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s an example of a European team in Arc that&#8217;s creating a new category?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One I find really fascinating is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/choice-options-limited\/about\/\">Choice Options<\/a>. The founder is Martin Gould, who ran I think a 100-person product org at Spotify. He&#8217;s quite experienced. And he observed that what Spotify did so well was to narrow &#8212; through understanding your taste &#8212; what you might like, fixing the paradox of choice. Now he&#8217;s trying to do that for various different categories across books, food destinations, and travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For Arc participants, what kind of time commitment is involved on both sides?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first week is in person, and the last week is in person in the Bay Area. And then in week four, we&#8217;ll go on a group field trip together. In Europe, we went to [Sequoia portfolio company] Klarna in Stockholm; the location for the Americas&#8217; program is TBD. In between, it&#8217;s about one-and-a-half hours, three days a week, with usually one of the Sequoia partners teaching a concept and a framework, or a founder or an operator from the field sharing real examples of how they built their company. On Fridays, there&#8217;s usually time for the founders to get back together for what we call a &#8216;peer board,&#8217; where they just get into their groups and share a little bit of what they do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s the seventh week for this European cohort, meaning they&#8217;re nearly done. Has Sequoia offered further funding to any of these startups?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a fundraising program, so nobody is expecting a check at the end. It&#8217;s not a fundraising Demo Day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Demo Day, I was reminded recently that Sequoia was an investor in Y Combinator many years ago and owned a direct stake in the business. Is that still the case?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not an LP any longer but I think we were many, many years ago; that&#8217;s definitely true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It would seem Arc is competitive with YC. Do you think it could strain that relationship?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I actually think it can be pretty complementary. YC is fantastic at giving you velocity, as well as helping you fundraise. I think our program is more geared toward long-term, foundational company building, and I can totally imagine someone going through both.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stepping back a bit,\u00a0 the market has shifted. A lot of &#8220;structure &#8220;is being introduced into deals where it wasn&#8217;t before.\u00a0 What are some of the terms with which Sequoia is most comfortable? What are some of the terms that you would advise your startups never to accept?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wearing my former founder hat &#8212;\u00a0 as well as my Sequoia hat &#8212; I would say it&#8217;s better to avoid structure. Even a down round with clean terms is probably better, because you can get wrapped up in structure and get your hands tied.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to look at all of this is that 2021 was just an abnormality. The multiples, the public stock market, the stimulus &#8212; it was just an anomaly. If you look at companies and sort of delete the 2021 valuations off a map and look at your trajectory from 2019 or 2018, maybe that&#8217;s a better way to look at it\u00a0 . . . I think our returns are actually somewhat correlated with that based on the analysis that I saw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the meantime, some founders might be wondering why they&#8217;re having to pare back their spending at the same time they are seeing Sequoia and many other firms continue to raise <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-07-05\/sequoia-china-raises-9-billion-as-investors-flock-to-big-funds#xj4y7vzkg\">billions of dollars<\/a> in investing capital.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Venture firms operate on the order of decades. Each fund traditionally has a 10-year life cycle and the idea is to outlive these market cycles &#8212; the highs and the lows.<\/p>\n<p>We are [closing] our growth and venture funds now, and they&#8217;re right\u00a0 on time. We raise them every two to two-and-a-half to three years. So there was no real acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>What we did do was change our structure a little bit. We added the Sequoia Capital Fund, so the venture and growth funds are now sub funds out of the Sequoia Capital Fund, and the Sequoia Capital Fund can hold public companies and is designed to allow us to break that 10-year cycle [where] you must give your [investors their] distributions and instead let us manage our LPs&#8217; money over time in the companies that compound over time and are really truly generational. We did some backwards-looking math and found that if we had actually managed for our LPs&#8217; [shares] and [they hadn&#8217;t cashed out these shares upon receiving them], we would have returned much more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The investment firm Sequoia Capital has no shortage of internal programs for the founders it backs.

are we in a startup recession or what?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">I don&#8217;t know<\/span> what is going on in the startup market and it&#8217;s a bit of a pain in the ass.<\/p>\n<p>The larger American economy, home to the largest technology startup and venture capital markets in the world, could be in a recession right now. We don&#8217;t know. To reach a technical recession, we need two successive quarters of negative GDP growth. We got that in Q1, when the United States&#8217; gross domestic product fell 1.6% after growing 6.9% in the fourth quarter of last year.<\/p>\n<p>Goldman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/07\/07\/goldman-slashes-gdp-forecast-for-the-second-quarter-to-just-barely-above-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinks<\/a> that we&#8217;re going to avoid a recession with a paltry bit of growth when Q2 data settles. The Atlanta Fed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlantafed.org\/cqer\/research\/gdpnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinks<\/a> we might land in a recession. We&#8217;ll see, but the smart money is not entirely sure yet which way the economy is heading.<\/p>\n<p>The startup market feels similar. Venture investors have been ringing alarm bells for months now, and the IPO market is as dead as hopes for a post-Brexit boom. It&#8217;s easy to find commentary from various actors in the startup business &#8212; both those building and those investing &#8212; noting that the market is a mess and that many upstart technology companies are in for a drubbing.<\/p>\n<p>There is some good reason for that. The incoming valuation implosion at Klarna is a good example of how some of 2021 is not translating into 2022. Many a unicorn is expected to struggle to raise more capital at a price that is palatable, and thus many down rounds and last-ditch rounds are anticipated.<\/p>\n<p>And yet.<\/p>\n<p>Funding totals are down but far from out. And with unicorns still being born at a good clip, just how much trouble is really out there for startups?<div

Gjonbalic is also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastacqii.com\/team\"> listed<\/a> as an advisor to Fast Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company that unsuccessfully attempted to take Fertitta Entertainment, a dining, hospitality, and gaming giant, public.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are coming in and showing what the experience should be,\u201d Gjonbalic<a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/startups\/butler-hospitality-secures-15m-series-a-to-provide-better-in-room-hotel-experiences\/\"> told<\/a> Crunchbase in a 2020 interview. &#8220;You don\u2019t need a cart in the room or a $20 service charge to deliver food. Guests want good packaging, a good menu, price transparency, and to be able to track their order. This should have been happening a long time ago.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Butler owned five different restaurant concepts that it staffed, including Standard by Butler (a casual bar and grill), Prime by Butler (an American brasserie) and Super Franc (a Tuscan steakhouse). Hotels could choose which concepts to have available to their guests; Butler handled the integration, experience, menu design, and packaging. To customers, it pledged to deliver orders &#8212; including &#8220;convenience&#8221; items on the side, like chargers and shaving cream &#8212; in under 30 minutes, charged directly to their hotel bill.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After a seed round and bootstrapped funding from Gjonbalic, Butler went on to raise $15 million in Series A contributions from The Kraft Group, &amp;vest, Scopus Ventures and Mousse Partners. The company subsequently raised $30 million from backers including Shamrock Holdings, Maywic Select Investments, and Platform Ventures, bringing Butler&#8217;s total raised to &#8220;north of&#8221; $50 million.<\/p>\n<p>In a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/butler-raises-additional-32m-to-continue-building-the-hospitality-platform-of-the-future-301411425.html\"> press release<\/a> issued last October, Butler said that it wanted to more than double its presence to 12 markets in the U.S. with plans to service rooms in cities including Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh (expanding from its bases in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Miami, Denver, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.) The company said that Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, and Marriott were among its over 400 hospitality partners, which were big gets for the small operation.<\/p>\n<p>But some ex-employees say trouble was brewing behind the scenes.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs of instability<\/h2>\n<p>Butler no doubt took a hit as the pandemic depressed service and hospitality spending. In April 2020, the company<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalpay.org\/paycheck-protection-program\/b-hospitality-corp-new-york-ny\"> received<\/a> a $600,000 loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. But Butler, intent on expansion, continued to take on expensive new hotel restaurant leases.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, Butler was<a href=\"https:\/\/www.butlerhospitality.com\/blog\/refer-a-new-hotel-to-butler-and-get-500\/\"> offering<\/a> $500 prepaid Visa cards for every hotel partner successfully referred to it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Butler expanded its national footprint in 2021, hoping to capitalize on the travel recovery,&#8221; Gjonbalic told TechCrunch via email. However, the startup found COVID-19 having both direct and indirect lasting effects, he added, among them labor and supply chain shortages, closed international borders, and continued delays of corporate and group travel.<\/p>\n<p>As travel recovered in late Q1 2022, Butler&#8217;s challenges didn&#8217;t go away, with inflation, geopolitical issues (i.e., the war in Ukraine), interest rate hikes, and the bigger pressure on tech finance all creating a challenging fundraising environment for the startup. This led to commitments falling through &#8220;abruptly,&#8221; Gjonbalic said.<\/p>\n<p>But Gjonbalic and the rest of the company&#8217;s senior leaders failed to communicate the severity of the situation, according to ex-staffers who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity. Just weeks prior to the mass firings, one ex-employee claims they were told Butler had no cash flow issues and that &#8220;the next [financing] round was coming.&#8221; Another says they were assured that the company&#8217;s board of directors would give six months of runway regardless of how the next fundraise went.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the complaints have been more public and open. Kelly Buerger, a former launch manager for Butler, filed a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/docket\/63373219\/buerger-v-b-hospitality-corp\/\"> class action lawsuit<\/a> against the company in June alleging that Butler failed to give employees sufficient notice of their termination. Under the New York WARN Act and the federal WARN Act, companies employing 50 or more employees are generally required to give several weeks\u2019 advance notice of mass layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Beginning on or about April 22, 2022, and within 90 days therefrom, [Butler] terminated hundreds of its employees,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;[Butler] was required by the WARN Act to give [Bruger] and putative class members at least 60 days advance written notice of their termination &#8230; [Butler also] failed to pay [Brueger] and each of the putative class members their respective wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, accrued holiday pay and accrued vacation for 60 days following their respective terminations, along with other vested compensation perks during the 60-day period.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some ex-Butler employees who were promised health benefits through August received an email a week after the dissolution indicating their plans would been terminated early.<\/p>\n<h2>Layoffs begin<\/h2>\n<p>Butler began taking extraordinary measures to preserve its remaining capital. An employee at one of Butler&#8217;s hotel customers said the company began discontinuing services and introducing new fees without advanced warning. For example, Butler began charging for deliveries that previously had been free.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the year, there was a round of layoffs at Butler &#8212; fewer than 20 people &#8212; that management described to employees as &#8220;a one-time thing.&#8221; A few weeks later, about 50 people were furloughed in what Butler internally called a response to &#8220;challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We regret to inform you that due to &#8230; circumstances faced by [Butler] resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the critical need to conserve our cash resources, we have made the very difficult decision to place you on a temporary furlough,&#8221; a notice received by one ex-Butler employee reads. &#8220;We are hopeful that [Butler&#8217;s] financial condition will improve, and we hope to recall you from temporary furlough to resume your position with [Butler] by no later than November 9, 2022.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The larger-scale layoffs started in May, shortly after Butler hired a new COO and chief revenue officer. The company dissolved on May 13.<\/p>\n<p>Gjonbalic claims that the board and Butler&#8217;s legal counsel at Cooley, a Palo Alto-based law firm, explored &#8220;several options&#8221; to try to save the company, but ultimately decided to shut down and dissolve the company on May 12.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On May 13, Delaware counsel was retained to assist with the shutdown and to liquidate the business assets and the employees were terminated on May 13,&#8221; Gjonbalic told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;Butler is not operational. The board agreed &#8230; to shut down the company, but this is not something that happens overnight, so several excess liability hubs were assigned or transitioned back to hotel ownership to assist with accomplishing this as quickly as possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Employees laid off during the final round, which included operational staff working at Butler-leased restaurants, were informed in a three-minute Google Meet call. An ex-employee told TechCrunch that services stopped abruptly after the company&#8217;s dissolution; guests at one hotel with a Butler contract were suddenly unable to order room service.<\/p>\n<p>Vestiges of the company remain. An ex-employee with knowledge of the matter said that people formerly employed by Butler were direct-messaging the company&#8217;s Instagram account, which remains active, to ask about missing payments. Much of Butler&#8217;s senior leadership haven&#8217;t updated their profiles on LinkedIn to reflect the shutdown, and Butler&#8217;s website makes no mention of it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hotel owners and hotel management companies took over most of [Butler&#8217;s] lease obligations, and fortunately my dad agreed to assume two of the remaining lease obligations and debts off the company\u2019s hands,&#8221; Gjonbalic said [in an email to TechCrunch]. &#8220;An assignee is in place and he is handling all post-dissolution matters.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Cautionary tale<\/h2>\n<p>While an extreme example, Butler is hardly the only food delivery startup to have fallen on hard times<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/03\/the-delivery-market-is-coming-down-from-its-pandemic-highs\/\"> recently<\/a>.

rel=\"noopener\">DEUNA<\/a>, a Mexico-based one-click checkout commerce startup, is officially joining Latin America\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/445860\/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam\/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20retail%20e%2Dcommerce,160%20billion%20dollars%20by%202025.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly $100 billion e-commerce sector<\/a> with $30 million in Series A funding after largely staying under the radar since being founded in late 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Co-founders Roberto Enrique Kafati Santos and Jose Maria Serrano started the company after a career at McKinsey leading digital payments for Kafati Santos and at delivery company JOKR for Serrano. They also recently brought on Jose Jorge Molina, who was previously chief marketing officer for Bitso, to join the founding team to lead marketing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople were looking for help digitizing their businesses, and as we started looking into this, realized that brands needed help selling online,\u201d Kafati Santos told TechCrunch. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t understand the opportunity to do an e-commerce platform, but the decision was obvious, and we have done payments ever since. We helped several brands last year and have now increased our sales five times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>E-commerce is a hot market in Latin America, with the founders estimating it will grow 30% each year. However, they say the market continues to be plagued by three challenges: customer acceptance, conversion and fraud.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why they say they are building a \u201cCommerce 3.0\u201d that will tackle all three of those. DEUNA provides a payments infrastructure that integrates with major payment providers and alternative payment methods and provides merchants access to more than 3 million users. In addition, merchants can use the tools to handle payment orchestration, payment processing, fraud prevention and lifecycle management based on actionable user real-time analytics.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, to combat acceptance, DEUNA will offer multiple payment methods, which Kafati Santos believes will also help solve the problem of conversion, where some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/shopping-cart-abandonment#:~:text=According%20to%20Baymard%20Institute%2C%2069.57,them%20will%20leave%20without%20purchasing.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70% of customers abandon their cart at checkout<\/a>. The company has been able to increase acceptance rates by 40% and prove out about three times higher conversion rates, he said.<\/p>\n<p>In Latin America, that is often due to about half of customers not having their payment method of choice approved. On top of that, those whose payment is approved, one in 20 payments are fraudulent, for example, a payment made with a stolen credit card, he added. That\u2019s why DEUNA is building its own fraud tech with custom rules for merchants that cuts down on payment fraud and denials.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e8gbBFRC64\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/08\/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation\/\">Addi raises $75M to advance &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; in LatAm, nearly triples valuation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Addi raises $75M to advance &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; in LatAm, nearly triples valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/08\/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation\/embed\/#?secret=m6XJbSW09J#?secret=e8gbBFRC64\" data-secret=\"e8gbBFRC64\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>With a rather large e-commerce market, a lot of one-click competitors have entered, mainly driven by the consumer buying behavior shift that took place over the past two years. We recently saw<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/sleek-wants-to-be-the-last-shopping-check-out-form-you-ever-fill-out\/\"> Sleek raise $1.7 million<\/a> to get started in a space that is dominated by companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/28\/ownit-helps-brands-sell-products-at-the-point-of-discovery-with-one-click\/\">Ownit<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/14\/online-checkout-bolt-decacorn\/\">Bolt<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/12\/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation\/\">Checkout.com<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/10\/nigerian-one-click-checkout-platform-ourpass-raises-1m-pre-seed-wants-to-build-fast-for-africa\/\">OurPass<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api\/\">Rapyd<\/a>, which have collectively raised more than $3 billion in investments within the past 18 months. During that time, Colombia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/08\/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation\/\">Addi said it was getting into the one-click space after taking in a $75 million<\/a> extension to its Series B.<\/p>\n<p>Kafati Santos said DEUNA has been able to differentiate itself from many of the players in that it is solving the whole acceptance-conversion-fraud triangle, whereas others are just going after pieces of it.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past two years, Kafati Santos and Serrano had bootstrapped the business for the most part, with the exception of a $7 million seed round in October 2021. They have grown revenue 120 times in the last year and brought on clients, including KFC, Pappos and Dunkin&#8217; Donuts.<\/p>\n<p>This new investment of $30 million was led by Activant Capital, with participation from Valor Capital, Abstract Ventures, Acrew Capital, Upload Ventures and a group of individual founder investors from companies including Plaid, Kavak, Jeeves, Xepelin, iFood and R2. The company raised a total of $37 million.<\/p>\n<p>The founders plan to use the new capital to expand its presence in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile, product development, go-to-market, adding employees to its team of 90 and entering new countries, like Brazil, in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>David Yang, partner at Activant Capital, said his firm has invested in a number of fintech companies and believes DEUNA is doing something unique.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRaising a $30M Series A is hard in any market, but with their backdrop, we had high conviction in what they are doing,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThis is a big market opportunity, in some ways more compelling than the U.S. DEUNA\u2019s approach is also holistic rather than just pieces of the market. The team, and the vision they had with Jose (Molina) joining, has had strong execution to date.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

has come a long way in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Until somewhat recently, road-tripping required lots of advance planning. Charging speeds were slow, necessitating stops that easily stretched past 30 minutes. Sessions were stymied by broken or vandalized equipment or inconsiderate fossil-fueled car owners blocking the charging points.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, those days are largely over. Charging networks today are larger and more reliable, and many new EVs can add a decent amount of range in just 20 to 30 minutes.

startup hopes to get us to Net Zero via its platform to construct wooden buildings"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">One of the stunning facts that\u2019s emerged over the last few years &#8211; especially as VCs and startups have turned their attention towards the climate crisis &#8211; is that our cities produce an enormous amount of CO2: in fact, buildings are responsible for around 40% of global CO2 emissions. But of course, the problem is that cities are unlikely to stop building, and growiing.<\/p>\n<p>Some estimates say that if global urban growth continues at its current pace, then we\u2019d build a New York City <em>every month<\/em> for the next 40 years. So if we could reduce this amount or transition this growth to \u2018net zero\u2019 (or better) we&#8217;d would do to a lot alleviate the impending, and disastrous, affects of climate change. This is why we areseeing so many new climate funds appear which are concentrating on the built environment.<\/p>\n<p>A large part of this problem is that concrete and steel are just not sustainable materials, unlike (say) timber.<\/p>\n<p>Now, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.011h.com\/en\/\">011h<\/a>&#8220;, based out of Barcelona, thinks it might have the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the building processes that use manual labor and usustainalble materials don&#8217;t pass muster, so if you can standardize and digitise the building process to make it repeatable and scalable (says 011h)  while shifting sustainable materials \u2013 like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/energy-and-environment\/2020\/1\/15\/21058051\/climate-change-building-materials-mass-timber-cross-laminated-clt\">mass timber<\/a> \u2013 you can allow architects, builders, developers and investors to make net-zero buildings faster, cheaper and more sustainable.<\/p>\n<p>It all sounds lovely in theory, but in fact 011h says it has already completed such a project with Renta Corporaci\u00f3n, a publicly-traded developer, where the \u2018embodied carbon\u2019 of the building was reduced by more than 90% compared to conventional methods, while construction timelines were reduced by 35%. This has led to three more major projects being commissioned.<\/p>\n<p>No doubt partly as a result of this, 011h has now raised a significant \u20ac25m in Series A funding. The funding round was led by Redalpine, accompanied by Seaya Andromeda and Breega, with the participation of Aldea Ventures, among others. Previous investors also joined the round, including Giuseppe Zocco, Foundamental and A\/O Proptech, which accelerates 011h\u2019s ambition to create a sustainably-built world.\u00a0<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The funding will be used to further develop 011h\u2019s platform, building system and team, initially focusing on Spain, then internationally.<\/p>\n<p>Lucas Carn\u00e9 , Co-Founder and Co-CEO of 011h, said the impact of reducing the carbon footprint of building can\u2019t be iunderestimated: \u201cIf the embodied carbon of every building were reduced by more than 90%, this would reduce 10% of annual global C02 emissions, this is equivalent to three gigatonnes of C02 every year. In real terms, this is almost 2x more carbon than completely transitioning from petrol to electric vehicles; and is equivalent to eliminating 1 billion domestic gas boilers,\u201d he told me.<\/p>\n<p>Harald Nieder, General Partner of Redalpine, added in a statement: \u201cAt Redalpine, we believe that there are massive opportunities around sustainability. In fact, the opportunities are such that we are not looking for marginal improvements of the status quo. We are looking for teams that are aiming to have a real impact, worthy of the global challenges we are facing. Construction is both one of the most unsustainable industries and one of the least digital and the 011h vision is exactly what we were looking to support.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the stunning facts that\u2019s emerged over the last few years &#8211; especially as VCs and startups have turned their attention towards the climate crisis &#8211; is that our cities produce an enormous amount of CO2: in fact, buildings are responsible for around 40% of global CO2 emissions.

proactive <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/cybersecurity\/\">cybersecurity<\/a> tools, is preparing to expand outside of the U.S. for the first time following a mega $250 million Series F investment that takes its valuation to $5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The investment, backed by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/allianz-x\/\">Allianz X<\/a>, Valor Equity Partners and Kinetic Partners, comes less than a year after the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/28\/cyber-insurance-firm-coalition-lands-205m-at-series-e-valued-at-3-5b\/\">company\u2019s $205 million Series E raise in September<\/a>, which valued the company at $3.5 billion. Since then, the company has more than tripled its customer base from 52,000 to 160,000, Joshua Motta, CEO and co-founder of Coalition, tells TechCrunch, and has seen an almost 200% increase in revenue growth.<\/p>\n<p>This, Motta tells us, is a result of the booming cyber insurance startup. While many in the cybersecurity industry are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/29\/cybersecurity-startups-layoffs\/\">starting to feel the effects of the economic storm<\/a>, the cyber insurance market grew an estimated $7.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to continue growing at 25% year on year. Coalition, which classes AIG, Beazley and Hiscox as its fiercest competitors, tells TechCrunch that it remains \u201cone of the largest providers\u201d in the market thanks to its \u201cunique combination&#8221; of tech, data and insurance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis expertise allowed Coalition to build a strategic underwriting advantage by actively analyzing data we\u2019ve accumulated through public web scans, infosec capability and through our own claims and incident tracking,\u201d Motta tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe use all this data not only to select better risk but also to help spot and prevent cyber threats for our policyholders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the startup\u2019s recent growth and a recent partnership with international financial services provider Allianz, Coalition tells TechCrunch that for the first time since its founding in 2017, it\u2019s planning to offer its cyber insurance policies in the U.K. Until now, its services have been available only in the U.S. and Canada.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis funding will be critical in powering our international presence, and reaching more communities with our tools,\u201d Motta said, adding that the company will also use the $250 million investment for hiring and retaining talent.<\/p>\n<p>However, Motta wouldn\u2019t be pressed on whether this will be the company\u2019s last raise before Coalition plots its exit, despite telling TechCrunch back in September that its Series E raise could be its final funding round before the startup prepares to go public.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coalition, a San Francisco-based startup that combines cyber insurance and proactive cybersecurity tools, is preparing to expand outside of the U.S. for the first time following a mega $250 million Series F investment that takes its valuation to $5 billion.

wants to invest $1 million in your idea, then teach you how to really sell it"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The investment firm Sequoia Capital has no shortage of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/sequoia-capital-has-internal-crash-courses-for-its-founders-heres-how-they-work\/\">internal programs<\/a> for the founders it backs. The idea is to help its startups not merely by sheer dint of their affiliation with Sequoia but by helping them at the outset with everything from storytelling to recruiting strategies in order to give them an edge over rivals.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sequoia is using some of that know-how for a longer, seven-week-long program called Arc that it&#8217;s using to bring even more promising founders into the fold. The idea, broadly speaking, is to invest $1 million in each company that fits the firm&#8217;s criteria, after which Sequoia brings the startups together both in person and virtually before gathering them together again to present what they&#8217;ve learned to the partnership &#8212; along with potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, 17 startups are finishing the program in Europe and roughly the same number will be welcome into a U.S. and Latin America program this September. (Startups can apply <a href=\"https:\/\/arc.sequoiacap.com\/\">here <\/a>through July 22.) To learn more, we talked today with Sequoia partner Jess Lee, who is leading the initiative this fall. We also talked with Lee about whether Y Combinator might see Arc as a competitor, the deal terms that startups should never accept, and more. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Arc is an outgrowth of Sequoia&#8217;s internal programs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>JL: That&#8217;s right. There&#8217;s so much that goes into building an amazing company, and what we&#8217;ve tried to do over the course of many years, across multiple programs, is boil all of that down into foundational company building concepts on topics like culture, hiring, product, customer obsession, and business model, and [we&#8217;re] packing that into Arc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You received thousands of applications for the Europe program. Who reads all those applications?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All the investors at Sequoia on the early team are reading them. We talked with many, many founders who applied and ultimately ended up with this wonderful class.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Each of these teams receives $1 million dollars. What size stake does Sequoia receive in exchange for its capital? Is it 10%? More?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have flexibility around the terms. What you said would be pretty typical for some folks for whom this is the first check. Then there are some folks who were already in the process of raising their seed round, and so we put $1 million into that round; [others] even opened up their last round to join the program. So there&#8217;s definitely a little bit of a range. Most of the companies are pre-seed or seed, though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The program uses the word &#8220;outlier&#8221; to describe what it&#8217;s looking to fund, but it sounds like Sequoia doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;outlier&#8221; to mean that it is seeking out founders from non-traditional backgrounds.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really looking for founders who want to build long-term, transformational, category-defining companies . . . that carve out a new market. There is no one we&#8217;d rule out, but it&#8217;s more about the scale of ambition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s an example of a European team in Arc that&#8217;s creating a new category?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One I find really fascinating is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/choice-options-limited\/about\/\">Choice Options<\/a>. The founder is Martin Gould, who ran I think a 100-person product org at Spotify. He&#8217;s quite experienced. And he observed that what Spotify did so well was to narrow &#8212; through understanding your taste &#8212; what you might like, fixing the paradox of choice. Now he&#8217;s trying to do that for various different categories across books, food destinations, and travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For Arc participants, what kind of time commitment is involved on both sides?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first week is in person, and the last week is in person in the Bay Area. And then in week four, we&#8217;ll go on a group field trip together. In Europe, we went to [Sequoia portfolio company] Klarna in Stockholm; the location for the Americas&#8217; program is TBD. In between, it&#8217;s about one-and-a-half hours, three days a week, with usually one of the Sequoia partners teaching a concept and a framework, or a founder or an operator from the field sharing real examples of how they built their company. On Fridays, there&#8217;s usually time for the founders to get back together for what we call a &#8216;peer board,&#8217; where they just get into their groups and share a little bit of what they do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s the seventh week for this European cohort, meaning they&#8217;re nearly done. Has Sequoia offered further funding to any of these startups?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a fundraising program, so nobody is expecting a check at the end. It&#8217;s not a fundraising Demo Day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Demo Day, I was reminded recently that Sequoia was an investor in Y Combinator many years ago and owned a direct stake in the business. Is that still the case?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not an LP any longer but I think we were many, many years ago; that&#8217;s definitely true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It would seem Arc is competitive with YC. Do you think it could strain that relationship?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I actually think it can be pretty complementary. YC is fantastic at giving you velocity, as well as helping you fundraise. I think our program is more geared toward long-term, foundational company building, and I can totally imagine someone going through both.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stepping back a bit,\u00a0 the market has shifted. A lot of &#8220;structure &#8220;is being introduced into deals where it wasn&#8217;t before.\u00a0 What are some of the terms with which Sequoia is most comfortable? What are some of the terms that you would advise your startups never to accept?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wearing my former founder hat &#8212;\u00a0 as well as my Sequoia hat &#8212; I would say it&#8217;s better to avoid structure. Even a down round with clean terms is probably better, because you can get wrapped up in structure and get your hands tied.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to look at all of this is that 2021 was just an abnormality. The multiples, the public stock market, the stimulus &#8212; it was just an anomaly. If you look at companies and sort of delete the 2021 valuations off a map and look at your trajectory from 2019 or 2018, maybe that&#8217;s a better way to look at it\u00a0 . . . I think our returns are actually somewhat correlated with that based on the analysis that I saw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the meantime, some founders might be wondering why they&#8217;re having to pare back their spending at the same time they are seeing Sequoia and many other firms continue to raise <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-07-05\/sequoia-china-raises-9-billion-as-investors-flock-to-big-funds#xj4y7vzkg\">billions of dollars<\/a> in investing capital.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Venture firms operate on the order of decades. Each fund traditionally has a 10-year life cycle and the idea is to outlive these market cycles &#8212; the highs and the lows.<\/p>\n<p>We are [closing] our growth and venture funds now, and they&#8217;re right\u00a0 on time. We raise them every two to two-and-a-half to three years. So there was no real acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>What we did do was change our structure a little bit. We added the Sequoia Capital Fund, so the venture and growth funds are now sub funds out of the Sequoia Capital Fund, and the Sequoia Capital Fund can hold public companies and is designed to allow us to break that 10-year cycle [where] you must give your [investors their] distributions and instead let us manage our LPs&#8217; money over time in the companies that compound over time and are really truly generational. We did some backwards-looking math and found that if we had actually managed for our LPs&#8217; [shares] and [they hadn&#8217;t cashed out these shares upon receiving them], we would have returned much more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The investment firm Sequoia Capital has no shortage of internal programs for the founders it backs.

satellite internet service called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.starlink.com\/maritime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starlink Maritime<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of satellite internet on the water isn\u2019t a new one, but the actual service generally isn&#8217;t great: you can expect to pay hundreds or thousands per month for DSL-era speeds, topping out at a few megabits.<\/p>\n<p>Starlink Maritime is taking on the speed problem at least, saying it can provide customers with up to 350 Mbps. But with a monthly price of $5,000 and a one-time hardware fee of $10,000 for the dual terminals you&#8217;ll need, it&#8217;s not exactly more accessible. Though consumers do have the option to pause and unpause the plan and only be billed for the months they use.<\/p>\n<p>The terminals are &#8220;performance dishes&#8221; about twice the size of a home dish, Starlink&#8217;s Joseph Scarantino noted on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTwo Perf Dishes quadruples performance \u2014 so that helps reduce latency, ping drops, or loss of signal at sea because of the wider FOV provided by the two Dishes,\u201d he wrote. (The user&#8217;s profile has since been made private.)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the device still needs to be installed where there&#8217;s a clear view of the sky. Consumers can download the Starlink phone application to make sure their device is placed in the ideal location.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX claims Starlink Maritime \u201callows you to connect from some of the most remote waters in the world,&#8221; but currently their coverage area is limited to coastal waters in North America (primarily the U.S.), Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Chile.

href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2022\/07\/07\/elon-musk-twitter-jeopardy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new report from The Washington Post<\/a> that relies heavily on anonymous sources, the world&#8217;s richest man is still looking for a way out of a $44 billion deal of his own making.<\/p>\n<p>The Post reports that we&#8217;ll probably be seeing a &#8220;change in direction from Musk&#8217;s team&#8221; soon, according to its unnamed sources familiar with his plans. Further, Musk and friends have reportedly &#8220;stopped engaging in certain discussions&#8221; pertaining to funding the deal. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Binance and Fidelity are all on board for financing after signing on in early May.<\/p>\n<p>Musk appears to again be sowing doubt about Twitter&#8217;s bot estimates with these new shenanigans, but how and if those supposed concerns would even impact a deal he&#8217;s already signed onto is far from clear. The terms of the merger agreement include a stipulation that Musk would have to cough up $1 billion if he backs out of the deal, though it certainly looks like he&#8217;s combing through the fine print here looking for a way out of that too.<\/p>\n<p>Musk has made a lot of noise in recent months with the claim that Twitter misled him about the number of bots and spam accounts running wild on the platform. Twitter hosted a press call Thursday to review its bot-counting methodology, which has long found that fewer than 5% of the platform&#8217;s accounts aren&#8217;t real people.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IsuJ3E2CV9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/05\/sequoia-binance-and-fidelity-back-elon-musks-bid-for-twitter\/\">Sequoia, Binance and a16z back Elon Musk&#8217;s $44 billion Twitter bid<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Sequoia, Binance and a16z back Elon Musk&#8217;s $44 billion Twitter bid&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/05\/sequoia-binance-and-fidelity-back-elon-musks-bid-for-twitter\/embed\/#?secret=VtWnBdHLdz#?secret=IsuJ3E2CV9\" data-secret=\"IsuJ3E2CV9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Musk offered to buy Twitter back in April and the company soon accepted the offer.

All that remains now are a handful of devices and the dreams of some of its co-creators like Keats, who would go on to found <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/21\/after-essentials-failure-osom-plans-a-new-privacy-first-handset\/\">OSOM<\/a> a few months after Essential\u2019s demise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new way to interact with your device,\u201d Keats explains. \u201cIt actually worked really well one-handed with a big screen, a quality camera. It was so easy to use. And the length allowed us to have a good diversity of antennas inside the device, even though it was a small form factor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2349440\" style=\"width: 878px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2349440\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2349440\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"868\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp 868w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp?resize=768,435 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp?resize=680,385 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.25.07-PM.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2349440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Essential<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>OSOM\u2019s first phone, unveiled late last year, shares more design DNA with Essential\u2019s first handset, the PH1. From a pure hardware design perspective, it\u2019s not especially adventurous. Keats notes, as an aside, that people have stopped him on the street to ask whether it\u2019s the iPhone 14 while he\u2019s using it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur first product needs to be a more traditional device,\u201d OSOM\u2019s co-founder\/CEO explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t be like, \u2018here\u2019s a crazy brand with a crazy thing.\u2019\u00a0You\u2019re gonna sell like five.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So the Bay Area company went for a far more straightforward design with the OV1. It\u2019s a premium flagship, devoid of the glitz of, say, Nothing\u2019s first product. It is, among other things, a pragmatic framework on which the firm can execute future experiments &#8212; a sign of a serious company selling a product on serious concerns like user privacy.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As we discovered last month, however, the OV1 will never see the light of day. In its place comes the Saga, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/23\/osoms-ov1-is-now-solanas-web3-android-handset-saga\/\">a device branded by blockchain startup, Solana<\/a>, that offers the promise of a web3-first mobile experience. It is, effectively, the OV1 with a slightly different paint job (one of Solana\u2019s requests was the addition of green buttons to match the company\u2019s branding) and the blockchain company\u2019s web3 software stack.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2250527\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2250527\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2250527\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg 2084w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=768,315 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=680,279 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=1536,631 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=2048,841 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/osom.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2250527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OSOM<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Keats says he was introduced to Anatoly Yakovenko through a mutual friend when the Solana Labs CEO explained that the company was looking for a hardware maker to bring its dream of a blockchain-focused mobile device to life. The pair chatted over Signal and met over coffee a week later.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe realized there were such parallels between our fields and our visions for the future that meshed,\u201d Keats says. \u201cHe needed someone who could build hardware and arrange for it to be manufactured, who knew the players in Asia to actually build a quality device. We needed a user and a customer base that was excited about consumer choice, self-custody and individual privacy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keats won\u2019t disclose specifics of the deal, only explaining that suddenly OSOM has far less concern about its future. \u201cThey\u2019re our exclusive launch partner, and there are certain MOQs (minimum order quantity) that are involved in it. They\u2019ve made an investment in the company that guaranteed our future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The deal finds the already-delayed device\u2019s release moving from Q4 of this year to \u201cearly 2023.\u201d With the additional months ahead of release, OSOM opted to improve the camera sensor and bump up the RAM and storage, from 8\/128GB to 12\/256GB. Those numbers came with a price increase, pushing the device from the earlier promise of \u201cwell under\u201d $1,000 to right around it.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2341758\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2341758\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2341758\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Saga_Black.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2341758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Solana<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI said, look guys, first device, sell it for $1,000 and show that you\u2019re selling a $1,600 phone for $1,000,\u201d Keats explains. \u201cThat says a lot about what we\u2019re willing to do. We\u2019re trying to build that community, and building a super premium phone. The other side of that is it leaves us a window to do a lower cost version in the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>OSOM\u2019s decision to partner out of the gate is understandable. The U.S. phone market was regarded as nearly impossible to crack well before sales figures began dropping. Launching a new handset from a new mobile company seems like a recipe for disaster. Essential &#8212; with its pedigree and hype &#8212; reportedly sold fewer than 90,000 units its first year in existence.<\/p>\n<p>Keats cites Nothing founder Carl Pei\u2019s knack for building an organic fanbase as inspiration for OSOM\u2019s attempts to break into the U.S. market (Nothing, too, is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/06\/nothing-phone-nft\/\">betting on crypto\/web3 in a big way<\/a>). The promise of a privacy-focused handset with good specs and vanilla Android sounds good, but does all of that add up to product that can truly differentiate itself in a mature and saturated market place whose sales have consolidated among a few big players?<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2279135\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2279135\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2279135 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/OSOM_USB_plugged.png?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2279135\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OSOM<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>A crypto-focused deal differentiates the product in a crowded market without a radical Hail Mary like the GEM design, which can then be served up to Solana\u2019s loyal fanbase.

And while there\u2019s some concern that focusing so heavily on the crypto market will serve to pigeonhole the product out of the gate, Keats notes that users can uninstall the Solana stack if they\u2019re just looking for a new Android device without all of the web3 stuff.

More general availability will follow later.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the next month or two, they\u2019re gonna announce some pretty fun stuff for their developers and for early adopters,\u201d Keats explains.<\/p>\n<p>As for the future, alongside the wacky form factors, one can look toward various patents Essential was granted in its short life.

It&#8217;s estimated that over <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/01\/the-end-of-a-second-straight-month-of-layoffs-in-tech\/\">30,000 tech workers<\/a> have been laid off in the last two months, and social networks aren&#8217;t immune to the market downturn. Competitors like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/23\/snap-slow-hiring-miss-revenue-goal\/\">Snap<\/a> and Meta have also taken precautionary measures to manage their overhead in a time of economic upheaval. Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/jason-aten\/mark-zuckerberg-just-told-facebook-employees-to-quit-he-missed-most-important-point.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told employees<\/a> that they should prepare to do more work with fewer resources.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s executives have also witnessed some serious reshuffling since Parag Agrawal took over for Jack Dorsey as CEO. After the deal with Elon Musk was announced, Agrawal let go of consumer GM Keyvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.<\/p>\n<p>Agrawal has made a number of other <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/29\/daily-crunch-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-steps-down-board-moves-cto-parag-agrawal-to-top-spot\/\">key personnel changes<\/a> since assuming his new role in December. At the time, Twitter lost its chief design officer Dantley Davis and head of engineering Michael Montano. A month later, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/twitter-security-heads-leaving-shakeup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter lost two more leaders<\/a>, chief information security officer, Rinki Sethi, and head of security, Peiter Zatko.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some have been asking why a &#8216;lame-duck&#8217; CEO would make these changes if we&#8217;re getting acquired anyway,&#8221; Agrawal <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paraga\/status\/1525191759541960704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted<\/a>. &#8220;While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what&#8217;s right for Twitter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Agrawal himself will also likely lose his short-lived CEO role if Musk&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/24\/elon-musk-twitter-why\/\">acquisition<\/a> goes through.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a recent all-hands call with Twitter employees, Musk said that he&#8217;s not concerned with what title he&#8217;d have at the company, but that he wants to be heavily involved in product. At that meeting, Twitter employees voiced concerns about potential layoffs in response to the macroeconomic environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight now, costs exceed revenue. That\u2019s not a great situation,\u201d he said regarding potential Twitter layoffs. As CEO of Tesla, Musk just laid off nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/28\/tesla-layoffs-autopilot-workers-san-mateo\/\">200 employees<\/a> and shuttered the company&#8217;s San Mateo, California office amid <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/03\/elon-musk-orders-hiring-freeze-warns-of-job-cuts-in-latest-leaked-email\/\">broader job reductions<\/a>.

are we in a startup recession or what?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">I don&#8217;t know<\/span> what is going on in the startup market and it&#8217;s a bit of a pain in the ass.<\/p>\n<p>The larger American economy, home to the largest technology startup and venture capital markets in the world, could be in a recession right now. We don&#8217;t know. To reach a technical recession, we need two successive quarters of negative GDP growth. We got that in Q1, when the United States&#8217; gross domestic product fell 1.6% after growing 6.9% in the fourth quarter of last year.<\/p>\n<p>Goldman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/07\/07\/goldman-slashes-gdp-forecast-for-the-second-quarter-to-just-barely-above-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinks<\/a> that we&#8217;re going to avoid a recession with a paltry bit of growth when Q2 data settles. The Atlanta Fed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlantafed.org\/cqer\/research\/gdpnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinks<\/a> we might land in a recession. We&#8217;ll see, but the smart money is not entirely sure yet which way the economy is heading.<\/p>\n<p>The startup market feels similar. Venture investors have been ringing alarm bells for months now, and the IPO market is as dead as hopes for a post-Brexit boom. It&#8217;s easy to find commentary from various actors in the startup business &#8212; both those building and those investing &#8212; noting that the market is a mess and that many upstart technology companies are in for a drubbing.<\/p>\n<p>There is some good reason for that. The incoming valuation implosion at Klarna is a good example of how some of 2021 is not translating into 2022. Many a unicorn is expected to struggle to raise more capital at a price that is palatable, and thus many down rounds and last-ditch rounds are anticipated.<\/p>\n<p>And yet.<\/p>\n<p>Funding totals are down but far from out. And with unicorns still being born at a good clip, just how much trouble is really out there for startups?<div

That would equate to about 260 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/support\/energy\/solar-panels\/going-solar\/sizing-and-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">medium-sized<\/a> (9.6-kilowatt) home installations last quarter, or roughly 20 each week, per some back-of-the-napkin math. A more generous estimate (say, if we assume each installation were rated at just 5 kW) would still place Tesla somewhere around 38 per week, or nearly 4% of the way toward that 1,000-per-week target.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tesla originally showcased its roofs in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/28\/these-are-teslas-stunning-new-solar-roof-tiles-for-homes\/\">2016<\/a> on the street best known as Wisteria Lane, where &#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/10\/28\/with-teslas-solar-roof-youll-never-have-to-know-these-houses-are-solar-powered.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was filmed<\/a>. &#8220;It\u2019s not a thing on the roof. It is the roof,\u201d Musk said around then, pitching it as a sleek alternative to bolt-on solar systems that tend to stick out.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">So, what&#8217;s the holdup on the roofs? Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the report, but the company may have bit off more than it could chew. &#8220;We basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs,&#8221; <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/04\/29\/business\/energy-environment\/tesla-solar-shingles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Musk said<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> last year, as Tesla hiked its prices for some buyers. &#8220;You just can\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all situation,&#8221; he said.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Supply-chain issues could also be a factor. For the first quarter of 2022, Tesla reported a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teslarati.com\/tesla-energy-solar-suffered-in-q1-but-musk-still-expects-a-positive-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sharp drop<\/a> in solar deployments, most of which involve conventional panels. The company blamed &#8220;import delays beyond our control on certain solar components&#8221; for the decline.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Solar shingles aside, Tesla&#8217;s larger solar business is reportedly doing well lately. The company&#8217;s U.S. residential division just saw &#8220;its best quarter since 2017 right after the acquisition of SolarCity,&#8221; Electrek wrote. We&#8217;ll hear more on that when Tesla releases its second-quarter report on <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.tesla.com\/press-release\/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-second-quarter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 20<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond Tesla, several other companies have tried to make solar shingles happen, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/03\/gaf-energys-easy-install-solar-shingles-aim-to-outshine-tesla-roofs-and-traditional-panels\/\">GAF Energy<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/solar-roof-tile-and-energy-startup-sunroof-closes-e4-5m-led-by-inovo-venture-partners\/\">SunRoof<\/a>.
